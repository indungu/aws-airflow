1. Setup stack with EC2 instance(s), Redis, EFS, RDS Postgres.

Or without EFS everything on a single EC2 instance:

2. Install on EKS cluster (EC2 managed group) with Helm charts airflow/stable. Cannot use EKS with Fargate
since EFS is not supported (https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/826:
[EKS/Fargate] [Volumes]: Add support for EFS volumes to EKS Fargate Containers ).
3. Install on ECS cluster with Fargate and EFS since EFS support with ECS/Fargate is GA
(To use EFS with ECS, customers can add one or more volume definitions to an ECS task definition. A volume definition
includes an EFS file system ID, Access Point ID, and whether to enable IAM authorization or TLS encryption in transit.
Container definitions within the task definition can specify the task definition volumes that should be mounted
when that container is run. When a task that uses an EFS filesystem runs, ECS ensures that the EFS file system is
mounted and available to the containers that need access to it.)
